# Shortest-path-visualizer
This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

Breath-first Search (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

Depth-first Search (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
